# Project 1 - Project Proposal

## Introduction

As society progresses into a more digital world of continuous computer use and sedentary behaviours, several major health concerns have surfaced that directly affect user health and productivity. This project proposal will focus on three main health issues shared by student and professional communities: chronic physical health issues from static positions, limited access to mental health resources and universal aspects of hygiene education. 

This project proposes to develop **Health Guard AI**, a comprehensive digital health tool that facilitates the wellness of users through intelligent, thoughtful and empathic design, leveraging design frameworks from Human-Computer Interaction and Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being.

## Problem

Despite better medical technologies, serious issues persist that do not have a comprehensive fix for today's individual wellness issues. Our research has identified three interconnected problems affecting modern users:

### Posture Problem

Prolonged use of computer monitors can be a health concern as improper spinal alignment while sitting and not being mindful of that can cause long-lasting discomfort in the back, strains in the neck and general fatigue. Current products provide little effective feedback in real-time that allows users to remain in harmful positions without alerting them.

**Usability Goals:**
- **Effectiveness:** Accurate monitoring in detecting poor postures
- **Safety:** Preventing or reducing musculoskeletal disorders through timely intervention
- **Utility:** Providing feedback in real time that users can act upon

**User Experience Goals:**
- **Helpful:** Developing better habits through consistent guidance
- **Motivational:** Providing positive reinforcement to encourage proper posture
- **Satisfying:** Documenting and celebrating improvement over time

### Hygiene Education Problem

Traditional hygiene education has inherent limitations on engagement. Conventional methods of teaching handwashing and sanitation practices often fail to create lasting behavioural changes and knowledge retention, particularly in shared environments like university libraries and dormitories.

![Hygiene Problem](./imgs/hygiene-problem.png)
*Figure 2: Communities often neglect basic hygiene practices in shared environments*

**Usability Goals:**
- **Effectiveness:** Successful knowledge transfer of hygiene concepts

---

### Mental Health Problem

The current mental health care system contains numerous access barriers. Many individuals choose not to talk about their anxiety or elevate mental health concerns to the provider level because of stigma, privacy concerns, and lack of immediate access, which results in unmet mental health needs.

![Mental Health Problem](./imgs/mental-health-problem.png)
*Figure 3: People with anxiety are often hesitant to share concerns or seek help, leaving mental health issues unaddressed*

**Usability Goals:**
- **Effectiveness:** Providing practical coping strategies for current challenges
- **Safety:** Maintaining adequate levels of confidentiality and data protection
- **Learnability:** Easy accessibility and intuitive use of mental health support features

**User Experience Goals:**
- **Trustworthy:** Ensuring users feel safe sharing sensitive data
- **Supportive:** Providing genuine emotional support and validation
- **Comforting:** Engaging with users empathetically during difficult times

---

## Proposed Solution

**Health Guard AI** is a comprehensive mobile application that functions as an integrated wellness platform including three specialized modules designed to address physical health, mental health, and preventive health collectively.

### System Overview

Health Guard AI brings together real-time posture feedback, empathetic mental health support, and gamified hygiene education into a single, cohesive platform. Each module is designed to be functionally effective while engaging users on an emotionally resonant level.

---

### Module 1: Posture Guard 

**Feature Description:**
Utilizes the device's built-in camera with on-device pose estimation to track user posture while performing specific tasks. Upon slouching detection, the system generates subtle haptic or auditory feedback.

**Example Scenario:**
A university student working on their laptop for an extended period begins to slouch. Their phone, positioned nearby, detects the postural change through the camera and sends a gentle haptic vibration reminder. The student immediately adjusts their posture without interrupting their workflow.

**Benefits:**
- **Real-time Correction:** Enables immediate postural correction without external hardware
- **Privacy-Focused:** Video data is processed on-device and never stored or transmitted
- **Health Prevention:** Reduces the risk of chronic back and neck pain from prolonged poor posture
- **Non-Intrusive:** Subtle feedback doesn't disrupt concentration or workflow

---

### Module 2: Hygiene Hub 

**Feature Description:**
Designed to encourage regular personal hygiene practices through customizable reminders for handwashing, hydration, and break times. The module transforms routine tasks into efficient and attractive habits through interactive AR guides demonstrating proper techniques and a reward system with points and achievements.

**Example Scenario:**
After two hours of studying, a reminder prompts the user to take a hydration break. Upon acknowledging the notification, a brief stretching routine appears through an AR animation overlaying the actual environment. After completing the routine, the user's profile gains points and unlocks a new "Wellness Warrior" achievement.

**Benefits:**
- **Habit Formation:** Promotes development of healthy daily routines
- **Physical Wellness:** Improves overall health and reduces repetitive strain injuries
- **Engagement:** Gamified elements increase motivation and long-term adherence
- **Visual Learning:** AR demonstrations ensure proper technique execution

### Module 3: Mind Mender 

**Feature Description:**
Provides a private journaling and mood tracking system through a secure, chat-based interface. The system offers mindfulness exercises and evidence-based coping mechanisms while maintaining complete data localization on the user's device to protect privacy.

**Example Scenario:**
A remote worker feeling stressed opens the Mind Mender module to document their daily thoughts and feelings. Based on the logged mood patterns, the application recommends a specific guided breathing exercise and cognitive reframing technique. All processing occurs locally on their device, ensuring complete privacy.

**Benefits:**
- **Mental Health Support:** Accessible, private tools for self-reflection and stress management
- **Privacy Assurance:** Complete local data storage builds trust and promotes open expression
